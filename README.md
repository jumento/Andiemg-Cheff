English Description AndieMG Chef (better known as Andrea’s Culinary Corner) has evolved! Born from a love for in-game cooking, this mod has grown into a complete culinary progression system. We’ve moved beyond simple crafting menus to bring you dedicated workstations, farming mechanics, and immersive dining.

Designed to extend playability, every dish serves a purpose. Transform underutilized items into complex, beneficial feasts that look as good as they taste.

🔗 Integration Add-on (New!) Do you use EasyHunger? We recommend installing our new bridge mod for the ultimate experience:

AndieMG Chef Linked: Connects both mods to work as one, unlocking incredible synergies and features.

Note: This is optional! AndieMG Chef works perfectly on its own if you don't use EasyHunger.
